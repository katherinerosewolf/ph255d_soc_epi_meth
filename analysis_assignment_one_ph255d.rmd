# Overall report

Detailed summary statistics are in Table 1.  The univariate analyses show a dataset of 4000 study participants, of whom 40 were missing data on age, 112 were missing data on race, 77 were missing data on education, and 580 were missing data on income.

Participants appear unevenly distributed among the boroughs, with Staten Island particularly poorly represented.  Middle-aged participants between 35 and 54 appear somewhat more represented than those in other groups.  A plurality of participants are white (40%), followed by African American (26.4%) and Hispanic/Latinx (24.0%).  The most common educational level was completed high school.  A plurality of participants (40%) had the lowest income level.  (Additional analyses should break out joint covariate distributions, for example, neighborhood income and percentage in poverty by race.)

In the bivariate analyses, 89% (n = 3562) of participants did not binge drink and 11% (n = 438) did.  Neighborhood income and neighborhood percent in poverty look similar between the two groups, although they are highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.89), indicating that I should not use them both in one model.  Binge drinking appeared particularly prevalent among participants in Manhattan compared to other boroughs and in the 25-34 year-old age group (subsequently declining with age), among college graduates, and at higher income levels.
